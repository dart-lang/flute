/// A widget that manages a [FocusNode] to allow keyboard focus to be given
/// to this widget and its descendants.
///
/// When the focus is gained or lost, [onFocusChange] is called.
///
/// For keyboard events, [onKey] is called if [FocusNode.hasFocus] is true for
/// this widget's [focusNode], unless a focused descendant's [onKey] callback
/// returns true when called.
///
/// This widget does not provide any visual indication that the focus has
/// changed. Any desired visual changes should be made when [onFocusChange] is
/// called.
///
/// To access the [FocusNode] of the nearest ancestor [Focus] widget and
/// establish a relationship that will rebuild the widget when the focus
/// changes, use the [Focus.of] and [FocusScope.of] static methods.
///
/// To access the focused state of the nearest [Focus] widget, use
/// [FocusNode.hasFocus] from a build method, which also establishes a relationship
/// between the calling widget and the [Focus] widget that will rebuild the
/// calling widget when the focus changes.
///
/// Managing a [FocusNode] means managing its lifecycle, listening for changes
/// in focus, and re-parenting it when needed to keep the focus hierarchy in
/// sync with the widget hierarchy. This widget does all of those things for
/// you. See [FocusNode] for more information about the details of what node
/// management entails if you are not using a [Focus] widget and you need to do
/// it yourself.
///
/// To collect a sub-tree of nodes into an exclusive group that restricts focus
/// traversal to the group, use a [FocusScope]. To collect a sub-tree of nodes
/// into a group that has a specific order to its traversal but allows the
/// traversal to escape the group, use a [FocusTraversalGroup].
///
/// To move the focus, use methods on [FocusNode] by getting the [FocusNode]
/// through the [of] method. For instance, to move the focus to the next node in
/// the focus traversal order, call `Focus.of(context).nextFocus()`. To unfocus
/// a widget, call `Focus.of(context).unfocus()`.

/// A [FocusScope] is similar to a [Focus], but also serves as a scope for its
/// descendants, restricting focus traversal to the scoped controls.
///
/// For example a new [FocusScope] is created automatically when a route is
/// pushed, keeping the focus traversal from moving to a control in a previous
/// route.
///
/// If you just want to group widgets together in a group so that they are
/// traversed in a particular order, but the focus can still leave the group,
/// use a [FocusTraversalGroup].
///
/// Like [Focus], [FocusScope] provides an [onFocusChange] as a way to be
/// notified when the focus is given to or removed from this widget.
///
/// The [onKey] argument allows specification of a key event handler that is
/// invoked when this node or one of its children has focus. Keys are handed to
/// the primary focused widget first, and then they propagate through the
/// ancestors of that node, stopping if one of them returns true from [onKey],
/// indicating that it has handled the event.
///
/// Managing a [FocusScopeNode] means managing its lifecycle, listening for
/// changes in focus, and re-parenting it when needed to keep the focus
/// hierarchy in sync with the widget hierarchy. This widget does all of those
/// things for you. See [FocusScopeNode] for more information about the details
/// of what node management entails if you are not using a [FocusScope] widget
/// and you need to do it yourself.
///
/// [FocusScopeNode]s remember the last [FocusNode] that was focused within
/// their descendants, and can move that focus to the next/previous node, or a
/// node in a particular direction when the [FocusNode.nextFocus],
/// [FocusNode.previousFocus], or [FocusNode.focusInDirection] are called on a
/// [FocusNode] or [FocusScopeNode].
///
/// To move the focus, use methods on [FocusNode] by getting the [FocusNode]
/// through the [of] method. For instance, to move the focus to the next node in
/// the focus traversal order, call `Focus.of(context).nextFocus()`. To unfocus
/// a widget, call `Focus.of(context).unfocus()`.
