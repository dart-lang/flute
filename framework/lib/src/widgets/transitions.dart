/// [Listenable], but it can be used with any [Listenable], including

///

/// This code defines a widget called `Spinner` that spins a green square
/// continually. It is built with an [AnimatedWidget].
///
/// ```dart imports
/// import 'dart:math' as math;
/// ```
///
/// ```dart preamble
/// class SpinningContainer extends AnimatedWidget {
///   const SpinningContainer({Key key, AnimationController controller})

///       child: Container(width: 200.0, height: 200.0, color: Colors.green),
///     );
///   }
/// }

/// AnimationController _controller;
///
/// @override

///
/// ## Relationship to [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget]s
///
/// [AnimatedWidget]s (and their subclasses) take an explicit [Listenable] as
/// argument, which is usually an [Animation] derived from an
/// [AnimationController]. In most cases, the lifecycle of that
/// [AnimationController] has to be managed manually by the developer.
/// In contrast to that, [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget]s (and their subclasses)
/// automatically manage their own internal [AnimationController] making those
/// classes easier to use as no external [Animation] has to be provided by the
/// developer. If you only need to set a target value for the animation and
/// configure its duration/curve, consider using (a subclass of)
/// [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget]s instead of (a subclass of) this class.
///
/// ## Common animated widgets
///
/// A number of animated widgets ship with the framework. They are usually named
/// `FooTransition`, where `Foo` is the name of the non-animated
/// version of that widget. The subclasses of this class should not be confused
/// with subclasses of [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget] (see above), which are usually
/// named `AnimatedFoo`. Commonly used animated widgets include:
///
///  * [AnimatedBuilder], which is useful for complex animation use cases and a
///    notable exception to the naming scheme of [AnimatedWidget] subclasses.
///  * [AlignTransition], which is an animated version of [Align].
///  * [DecoratedBoxTransition], which is an animated version of [DecoratedBox].
///  * [DefaultTextStyleTransition], which is an animated version of
///    [DefaultTextStyle].
///  * [PositionedTransition], which is an animated version of [Positioned].
///  * [RelativePositionedTransition], which is an animated version of
///    [Positioned].
///  * [RotationTransition], which animates the rotation of a widget.
///  * [ScaleTransition], which animates the scale of a widget.
///  * [SizeTransition], which animates its own size.
///  * [SlideTransition], which animates the position of a widget relative to
///    its normal position.
///  * [FadeTransition], which is an animated version of [Opacity].
///  * [AnimatedModalBarrier], which is an animated version of [ModalBarrier].
