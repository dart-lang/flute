/// An [InheritedWidget] that defines visual properties like colors
/// and text styles, which the [child]'s subtree depends on.
///
/// The [wrap] method is used by [captureAll] and [CapturedThemes.wrap] to
/// construct a widget that will wrap a child in all of the inherited themes
/// which are present in a specified part of the widget tree.
///
/// A widget that's shown in a different context from the one it's built in,
/// like the contents of a new route or an overlay, will be able to see the
/// ancestor inherited themes of the context it was built in.
///
/// {@tool dartpad --template=freeform_no_null_safety}
/// This example demonstrates how `InheritedTheme.capture()` can be used
/// to wrap the contents of a new route with the inherited themes that
/// are present when the route was built - but are not present when route
/// is actually shown.
///
/// If the same code is run without `InheritedTheme.capture(), the
/// new route's Text widget will inherit the "something must be wrong"
/// fallback text style, rather than the default text style defined in MyApp.
