/// A widget that combines the functionality of [Actions], [Shortcuts],
/// [MouseRegion] and a [Focus] widget to create a detector that defines actions
/// and key bindings, and provides callbacks for handling focus and hover
/// highlights.
///
/// This widget can be used to give a control the required detection modes for
/// focus and hover handling. It is most often used when authoring a new control
/// widget, and the new control should be enabled for keyboard traversal and
/// activation.
///
/// {@tool dartpad --template=stateful_widget_material_no_null_safety}
/// This example shows how keyboard interaction can be added to a custom control
/// that changes color when hovered and focused, and can toggle a light when
/// activated, either by touch or by hitting the `X` key on the keyboard when
/// the "And Me" button has the keyboard focus (be sure to use TAB to move the
/// focus to the "And Me" button before trying it out).
///
/// This example defines its own key binding for the `X` key, but in this case,
/// there is also a default key binding for [ActivateAction] in the default key
/// bindings created by [WidgetsApp] (the parent for [MaterialApp], and
/// [CupertinoApp]), so the `ENTER` key will also activate the buttons.
