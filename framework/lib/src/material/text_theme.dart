/// ## Migrating from the 2014 names
///
/// The Material Design typography scheme was significantly changed in the
/// current (2018) version of the specification
/// ([https://material.io/design/typography](https://material.io/design/typography)).
///
/// The 2018 spec has thirteen text styles:
/// ```
/// NAME         SIZE  WEIGHT  SPACING
/// headline1    96.0  light   -1.5
/// headline2    60.0  light   -0.5
/// headline3    48.0  regular  0.0
/// headline4    34.0  regular  0.25
/// headline5    24.0  regular  0.0
/// headline6    20.0  medium   0.15
/// subtitle1    16.0  regular  0.15
/// subtitle2    14.0  medium   0.1
/// body1        16.0  regular  0.5   (bodyText1)
/// body2        14.0  regular  0.25  (bodyText2)
/// button       14.0  medium   1.25
/// caption      12.0  regular  0.4
/// overline     10.0  regular  1.5
/// ```
///
/// ...where "light" is `FontWeight.w300`, "regular" is `FontWeight.w400` and
/// "medium" is `FontWeight.w500`.
///
/// The [TextTheme] API was originally based on the original material (2014)
/// design spec, which used different text style names. For backwards
/// compatibility's sake, this API continues to expose the old names. The table
/// below should help with understanding the mapping of the API's old names and
/// the new names (those in terms of the 2018 material specification).
///
/// Each of the [TextTheme] text styles corresponds to one of the
/// styles from 2018 spec. By default, the font sizes, font weights
/// and letter spacings have not changed from their original,
/// 2014, values.
///
/// ```
/// NAME       SIZE   WEIGHT   SPACING  2018 NAME
/// display4   112.0  thin     0.0      headline1
/// display3   56.0   normal   0.0      headline2
/// display2   45.0   normal   0.0      headline3
/// display1   34.0   normal   0.0      headline4
/// headline   24.0   normal   0.0      headline5
/// title      20.0   medium   0.0      headline6
/// subhead    16.0   normal   0.0      subtitle1
/// body2      14.0   medium   0.0      body1 (bodyText1)
/// body1      14.0   normal   0.0      body2 (bodyText2)
/// caption    12.0   normal   0.0      caption
/// button     14.0   medium   0.0      button
/// subtitle   14.0   medium   0.0      subtitle2
/// overline   10.0   normal   0.0      overline
/// ```
///
/// Where "thin" is `FontWeight.w100`, "normal" is `FontWeight.w400` and
/// "medium" is `FontWeight.w500`. Letter spacing for all of the original
/// text styles was 0.0.
///
/// The old names are deprecated in this API.
///
/// Since the names `body1` and `body2` are used in both specifications but with
/// different meanings, the API uses the terms `bodyText1` and `bodyText2` for
/// the new API.
///
/// To configure a [Theme] for the new sizes, weights, and letter spacings,
/// initialize its [ThemeData.typography] value using [Typography.material2018].
