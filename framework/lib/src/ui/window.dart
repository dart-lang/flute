/// A view into which a Flutter [Scene] is drawn.
///
/// Each [FlutterView] has its own layer tree that is rendered into an area
/// inside of a [FlutterWindow] whenever [render] is called with a [Scene].
///
/// ## Insets and Padding
///
/// {@animation 300 300 https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/window_padding.mp4}
///
/// In this illustration, the black areas represent system UI that the app
/// cannot draw over. The red area represents view padding that the view may not
/// be able to detect gestures in and may not want to draw in. The grey area
/// represents the system keyboard, which can cover over the bottom view padding
/// when visible.
///
/// The [viewInsets] are the physical pixels which the operating
/// system reserves for system UI, such as the keyboard, which would fully
/// obscure any content drawn in that area.
///
/// The [viewPadding] are the physical pixels on each side of the
/// display that may be partially obscured by system UI or by physical
/// intrusions into the display, such as an overscan region on a television or a
/// "notch" on a phone. Unlike the insets, these areas may have portions that
/// show the user view-painted pixels without being obscured, such as a
/// notch at the top of a phone that covers only a subset of the area. Insets,
/// on the other hand, either partially or fully obscure the window, such as an
/// opaque keyboard or a partially translucent status bar, which cover an area
/// without gaps.
///
/// The [padding] property is computed from both
/// [viewInsets] and [viewPadding]. It will allow a
/// view inset to consume view padding where appropriate, such as when a phone's
/// keyboard is covering the bottom view padding and so "absorbs" it.
///
/// Clients that want to position elements relative to the view padding
/// regardless of the view insets should use the [viewPadding]
/// property, e.g. if you wish to draw a widget at the center of the screen with
/// respect to the iPhone "safe area" regardless of whether the keyboard is
/// showing.
///
/// [padding] is useful for clients that want to know how much
/// padding should be accounted for without concern for the current inset(s)
/// state, e.g. determining whether a gesture should be considered for scrolling
/// purposes. This value varies based on the current state of the insets. For
/// example, a visible keyboard will consume all gestures in the bottom part of
/// the [viewPadding] anyway, so there is no need to account for
/// that in the [padding], which is always safe to use for such
/// calculations.

///    the platform as a separate window which can host other [FlutterView]s.
