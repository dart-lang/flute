/// A collection of resources used by the application.
///
/// Asset bundles contain resources, such as images and strings, that can be
/// used by an application. Access to these resources is asynchronous so that
/// they can be transparently loaded over a network (e.g., from a
/// [NetworkAssetBundle]) or from the local file system without blocking the
/// application's user interface.
///
/// Applications have a [rootBundle], which contains the resources that were
/// packaged with the application when it was built. To add resources to the
/// [rootBundle] for your application, add them to the `assets` subsection of
/// the `flutter` section of your application's `pubspec.yaml` manifest.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```yaml
/// name: my_awesome_application
/// flutter:
///   assets:
///    - images/hamilton.jpeg
///    - images/lafayette.jpeg
/// ```
///

/// obtaining the [AssetBundle] for the current [BuildContext] using
/// [DefaultAssetBundle.of]. This layer of indirection lets ancestor widgets
/// substitute a different [AssetBundle] (e.g., for testing or localization) at
/// runtime rather than directly replying upon the [rootBundle] created at build
/// time. For convenience, the [WidgetsApp] or [MaterialApp] widget at the top
/// of the widget hierarchy configures the [DefaultAssetBundle] to be the
