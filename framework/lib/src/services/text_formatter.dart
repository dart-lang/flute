/// ### [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] versus
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds]
///
/// Both [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] and
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds] make sure the final
/// length of the text does not exceed the max length specified. The difference
/// is that [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] truncates all text while
/// [MaxLengthEnforcement.truncateAfterCompositionEnds] allows composing text to
/// exceed the limit. Allowing this "placeholder" composing text to exceed the
/// limit may provide a better user experience on some platforms for entering
/// ideographic characters (e.g. CJK characters) via composing on phonetic
/// keyboards.
///
/// Some input methods (Gboard on Android for example) initiate text composition
/// even for Latin characters, in which case the best experience may be to
/// truncate those composing characters with [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced].
///
/// In fields that strictly support only a small subset of characters, such as
/// verification code fields, [MaxLengthEnforcement.enforced] may provide the
/// best experience.
/// {@endtemplate}

///  [TextField.maxLength] to limit the length of user input. [TextField] also
///  provides a character counter to provide visual feedback.

  ///
  /// For allow lists ([allow] is true), sequences between matches of
  /// [filterPattern] are replaced as one, regardless of the number of

  ///
  /// If [allow] is false, then the result will be "Int* the W**ds".

  /// [allow] is false, the result would be "Int* the W*ds" (with the
  /// two "o"s replaced by a single occurrence of the replacement
  /// string) because both of the "o"s would be matched simultaneously
  /// by the pattern.
