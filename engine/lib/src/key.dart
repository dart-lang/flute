  /// Although most of Flutter's keyboard events are transformed from native
  /// events, some events are not based on native events, and are synthesized
  /// only to conform Flutter's key event model (as documented in
  /// the `HardwareKeyboard` class in the framework).
  ///
  /// For example, some key downs or ups might be lost when the window loses
  /// focus. Some platforms provides ways to query whether a key is being held.
  /// If Flutter detects an inconsistency between the state Flutter records and
  /// the state returned by the system, Flutter will synthesize a corresponding
  /// event to synchronize the state without breaking the event model.
  ///
  /// As another example, macOS treats CapsLock in a special way by sending
  /// down and up events at the down of alterate presses to indicate the
  /// direction in which the lock is toggled instead of that the physical key is
  /// going. Flutter normalizes the behavior by converting a native down event
  /// into a down event followed immediately by a synthesized up event, and
  /// the native up event also into a down event followed immediately by a
  /// synthesized up event.
  ///
  /// Synthesized events do not have a trustworthy [timeStamp], and should not be
  /// processed as if the key actually went down or up at the time of the
  /// callback.
  ///
  /// [KeyRepeatEvent] is never synthesized.
