chrome:
  # It seems Chrome can't always release from the same build for all operating
  # systems, so we specify per-OS build number.
  #
  # The OS names here must match what recipe Python expression
  # `self.m.platform.name.capitalize()` evaluates to. See:
  #
  # recipe_modules/web_util/api.py
  Linux: 927388 # Major version 96
  Mac: 927385 # Major version 96
  Win: 927369 # Major version 96

## Firefox does not use CIPD. To update the version, simply update it in this
## file.
firefox:
  version: '83.0'

edge:
  launcher_version: '1.2.0.0'

safari_ios:
  # Make sure this version is the same version supported by LUCI macOS bots.
  # XCode on these bots will be updated once a year, do not forget to update
  # `heightOfHeader` during this time.
  major_version: 13
  minor_version: 0
  device: 'iPhone 11'
  # `xcrun simctl` command is used to take screenshots. It takes the screenshot
  # of the entire simulator. Therefore we need to crop all the parts other than
  # the browsers' content. This file must be in sync with the local and LUCI
  # versions of macOS, iOS Simulator, and Xcode.
  # `heightOfHeader` is the number of pixels taken by the phone's header menu
  # and the browsers address bar.
  # TODO: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65672
  height_of_header: 189
  # `heightOfFooter` is the number of pixels taken by the phone's navigation
  # menu.
  height_of_footer: 250
  # Most of the time tests use a portion of the screen to compare goldens
  # instead of the entire screen. This area is reprented by a rectangle
  # when taking screenshots. However the rectangle dimensions are in logical
  # coordinates. In order to convert these coordinates to coordinates on the
  # phone screeen we enlarge or shrink the area by applying a linear
  # transformation by a scale_factor (a.k.a. we perform isotropic scaling).
  # This value will be differ depending on the phone.
  # For iOS 13.0 iPhone 11 Pro, this number is 1.15.
  scale_factor: 1.00
